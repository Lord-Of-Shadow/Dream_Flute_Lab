# Dream_Flute_Lab

## Project Description

**Dream_Flute_Lab** is a research-driven project aimed at enhancing **commonsense reasoning** and **figurative language understanding** in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It extends the **DREAM model** by integrating **T5-BASE** and **BERT**, introducing the **DREAM-FLUTE** method to improve reasoning in question-answering tasks.

The project focuses on enriching NLP models with **scene elaborations**—additional contextual information that aids in interpreting **implicit meanings, figurative expressions, and logical reasoning**. By leveraging **DREAM’s ability to generate detailed elaborations**, the system enhances **question-answering accuracy** and **context comprehension**.

## Methodology

The project implements two key systems:

- **DREAM-FLUTE System 1**: Fine-tunes **BERT** on the **COS-E dataset** to improve commonsense question answering.
- **DREAM-FLUTE System 2**: Uses **DREAM** to generate elaborations and incorporates them into **T5-BASE**, enhancing model predictions and reasoning depth.

Both systems aim to refine NLP models' ability to process **implicit contextual knowledge**, bridging the gap between **linguistic interpretation** and **real-world reasoning**.
